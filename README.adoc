# Example Java SE + JAX-RS applications

This repository contains one application based on RestEasy, and another based on Jersey.
Those are JAX-RS (think RESTful services) implementations readily usable in a Java SE environment.
For example, small apps or 12 factor apps.


## Why and What?

Think what you will about the enterprise Java as a whole, some of their technologies are really neat.
Also, since they are more and more usable without any heavy frameworks or boilerplate or configuration,
they are a real contender in Java SE space.

JAX-RS allows you to build RESTful APIs in a type safe and easy way.


## How it works

This project contains a `jaxrs` resources archive, which is just a JAR really.
This JAR forms the actual application.
There’s an `IndexResource` that is exposed in the `/` path,
and it exposes two sub-resources in path `/articles` and `/inquiries`.

You can make `GET` requests to the `/articles` end point, and receive a JSON list of articles.
You can also `POST` inquiries the the `/inquiries` end point.

Then there are two Java applications: jersey-jdk and resteasy-jdk.
Both are really small.
All they do is, they use container specific way of constructing the JAX-RS container
and then start the JDK `HttpServer`.

That’s it. (See the source code for more comments.)


## How to try it out

I'm using *gradle* build system, but you do not need to install that in order to build this.
All you need is *Java SE JDK*, version 8.

Clone this repository:

  git clone https://github.com/vmj/jaxrs-se-example.git
  cd jaxrs-se-example

And build the app:

  ./gradlew installDist

Then run the Jersey based app:

  ./jersey-jdk/build/install/jersey-jdk/bin/jersey-jdk

And the RestEasy based app:

  ./resteasy-jdk/build/install/resteasy-jdk/bin/resteasy-jdk

If you're on Windows, add `.bat` suffix to each script (`gradlew.bat`, `jersey-jdk.bat`, `resteasy-jdk.bat`).

You can clean up, too

  ./gradlew clean

Have fun!
