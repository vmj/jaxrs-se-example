# Example Java SE + JAX-RS applications

This repository contains one application based on RestEasy, and another based on Jersey.
Those are JAX-RS (think RESTful services) implementations readily usable in a Java SE environment.
For example, small apps or 12 factor apps.


## Why and What?

Think what you will about the enterprise Java as a whole, some of their technologies are really neat.
Also, since they are more and more usable without any heavy frameworks or boilerplate or configuration,
they are a real contender in Java SE space.

JAX-RS allows you to build RESTful APIs in a type safe and easy way.


## How it works

This project contains a `jaxrs` resources archive, which is just a JAR really.
This JAR forms the actual application.
There’s an `IndexResource` that is exposed in the `/` path,
and it exposes two sub-resources in path `/articles` and `/inquiries`.

You can make `GET` requests to the `/articles` end point, and receive a JSON list of articles.
You can also `POST` inquiries the the `/inquiries` end point.

Then there are two Java applications: jersey-jdk and resteasy-jdk.
Both are really small.
All they do is, they use container specific way of constructing the JAX-RS container
and then start the JDK `HttpServer`.

That’s it. (See the source code for more comments.)


## How to try it out

I’m using gradle build system, but you do not need to install that in order to build this.
All you need is Java SE JDK, version 7 or newer. Both Oracle and OpenJDK should work.

Clone this repository:

  git clone https://github.com/vmj/jaxrs-se-example.git
  cd jaxrs-se-example

Then build the apps by invoking the provided build script.

E.g. if you’re on Linux or Unix or OSX, use:

  ./gradlew installDist

Or, if you’re on Windows, use:

  gradlew.bat installDist

Don’t worry, those will not install anything outside the source directory.
The apps are installed into build/install directories relative to the app source code.

Hence, you can run the apps like this:

  jersey-jdk/build/install/jersey-jdk/bin/jersey-jdk
  resteasy-jdk/build/install/resteasy-jdk/bin/resteasy-jdk

You can clean up, too

  ./gradlew clean
